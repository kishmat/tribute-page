            <p id="info">Abraham Benjamin de Villiers (born 17 February 1984), is a South African cricketer. In limited overs cricket he is an attacking
            batsman.
            He was named as the ICC ODI Player of the Year three times during his 15-year international career. His name was also featured in Wisden
            Cricketers of the Decade at the end of 2019. De Villiers began his international career as a wicket-keeper-batsman, but he has played most
            often solely as a batsman. He batted at various positions in the batting order, but predominantly in the middle-order. Noted as one of the
            most innovative and destructive batsmen in the modern era, De Villiers is known for a range of unorthodox shots, particularly behind the 
            wicket-keeper.He made his international debut in a Test match against England in 2004 and first played a One Day International (ODI) in
            early 2005. His debut in Twenty20 International cricket came in 2006. He scored over 8,000 runs in both Test and ODI cricket and is one
            of the very few batsmen to have a batting average of over fifty in both forms of the game.He holds the record for the fastest ODI century
            in just 31 balls. He also recorded the fastest ODI 50 and 150. De Villiers captained South Africa in all three formats, although after a 
            series of injuries he stepped down from the Test captaincy. In 2017 he stepped down from captaining the national limited-overs teams and
            in May 2018 announced his retirement from all forms of international cricket. However,in January 2020 De Villiers expressed his 
            intention to make an international comeback and play for South Africa in the 2020 T20 World Cup. </p>

                <h4>My words : </h3>
                <p>Abd is best batsmen in the world in my perspective. His stance to his fabulous shot over the fine leg are awesome to watch.
                    His career in the begining was not so extraordinary which was in his later days of cricket, in international career. He has sensational
                    career in ODI cricket and not much less in Test Cricket too. He has broken several records in ODI format of the game and has given
                    some bold records which are next to difficult to be broken to future ahead. His fan following was suprisingly more in sub continent countries
                    than in his home back in South Africa. He has enormous fan following in India, whose some part of credit goes to the heart of this game these days 'IPL' .
                    IPL has made cricket more entertaining and regarding entertainment you can never over shadow de Villiers batting and oh yeah fielding.
                    His earlier days used to be fielder in the team but after Mark Boucher decided to say good bye to this game, there was a Wk needed int team and here comes
                    Abd who continued with team but now as a wicket-keeper batsman. After having successful career in wicket-keeping, stunning catches and stumping 
                    again with the days remaining for the cricket to be lesser, he handed his gloves to the youngster in the team and started fielding.
                    His T20 career was better in IPL in comparision with International T20 with 3 centuries.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He decided to say good bye to international cricket after test series with Australia, in May 23 2018.
                    Yeah obiously, not a good day for me and all cricket fans in different parts of the world.
                    But also he is still going to enjoy the IPL for few more years, and entertain us with his wonderful innings.
